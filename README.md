# About Me

I am a fourth-year Biology student who addresses solving biological problems through Computation and System Science. My interests include modeling biological systems, bioinformatics, theoretical biology, and the philosophy of science.

# Currently

- I am a research assistant at the [Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Group](https://gibbslab.github.io/) at the National University of Colombia.
- Working on constraint-based modeling of metabolic networks.
- Learning Rust on [my own](https://github.com/hdescobarh/rustaceology-logbook).
